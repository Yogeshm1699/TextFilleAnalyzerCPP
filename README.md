# TextFilleAnalyzerCPP
A text file analyzer mini project that I did in year 1 at the University of Mauritius.
There are two files, one containing English sentences and the other Kreol sentences.
One main feature of this program is that it prompts for a word for each language and returns the number of occurences.
